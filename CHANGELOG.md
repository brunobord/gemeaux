# Gemeaux changelog

## master (unreleased)

* Confirmed Python 3.9 support.
* Added `BadRequestResponse` and `ProxyRequestRefusedResponse` to the example application.
* Fix InputResponse handling when transmitting the answer to the prompt.
* Added unittests to the `check_url` function.
* Added documentation about the available `Response` classes.
* Small refactor of basic classes, to force users to define their status code in derivative classes.
* Added the phonetics of the word "g√©meaux" in French.
* Added nice badges to `README.md` file.
* Change strategy for loading configuration / arguments. Easier testing and less naughty side-effects.
* Fixed the collections import in main file so its code is future-proof. Thanks @JonStratton (#13)
* Removed support of Python 3.6 and 3.7.
* Switched from Travis CI to Github Workflows

## v0.0.2 (2020-12-07)

### Following the Specs

* Added `TemplateResponse` & `TemplateHandler` classes for generating Gemini content using template files.
* Make sure returned responses endlines are not mixed, only CRLF.
* Handling mimetypes other than `text/gemini`. Clients would have to download them instead of trying to display them. Example app is amended.
* Redirect clients when pointing at a static subdirectory without a trailing slash. It caused misdirections because the client was requesting the "/document.gmi" instead of the "/subdir/document.gmi".
* Improve application resilience after auditing it with [gemini-diagnostic](https://github.com/michael-lazar/gemini-diagnostics). Everything is not perfect, but that's a good start, to be honest.
* Added `BadRequestResponse`, `ProxyRequestRefusedResponse` classes

### Other changes

* Improved conftest for pytest using fixtures for document content.
* Return version number when using the `--version` option.
* Display version number at startup on the welcome message.
* Added mimetype of response to the access log.
* Added documentation for Handlers.

## v0.0.1 (2020-12-04)

* Redirection (permanent or temporary) responses,
